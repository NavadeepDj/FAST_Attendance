My unrefined Abstract:-
"There is an increasing need of attendance efficiency now-a-days.Manual roll call has always been time-consuming.Although Biometric & Face recognition-based automated systems appear, it takes a lot of time. This project develops a Network-instant based attendance system which solves the problem like time, proxy, automation. The system uses networks & subnet web servers to process attendance in real-time.
This system successfully takes attendance in real-time and gives the result instantly, which can be accurately provided. This system can be used by universities, offices around the world."

After asking hwo to refien to better my publication of research paper:-
Thanks for sharing your abstract. You're on the right track ‚Äî the **core idea is strong**, but for a **research publication (like IEEE)**, the abstract should be **technically sound, polished, and professionally written**, with clarity and no vague or informal language.

## üß† Quick Evaluation of Your Current Abstract

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good:

* Focus on solving real problems: **time, proxy, efficiency**
* Mentions **network-based approach** (unique)
* Real-world application (universities, offices)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Improvement:

* **Grammatical issues** (e.g., "now-a-days", missing spaces, awkward phrasing)
* **Repetitive ideas** (e.g., ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù used twice)
* **Vague terminology** (e.g., "network-instant based attendance system" is unclear)
* **Lacks clarity** on **how** your method works differently
* Not in **formal IEEE tone**

## ‚úÖ Suggested Abstract (IEEE Style, Polished)

> **NetMark: Real-Time Network-Based Attendance System**
>
> Traditional attendance systems, including manual roll calls and biometric-based methods, are often time-consuming, prone to proxy issues, and difficult to scale. This paper proposes **NetMark**, a novel real-time attendance system that leverages subnet-based network authentication to record attendance instantly and accurately. The system uses device-level IP mapping and live subnet checks to verify presence, eliminating the need for expensive biometric hardware or camera-based recognition. Attendance data is processed through a lightweight HTTP protocol and stored in a cloud database for instant analytics and reporting. The proposed solution significantly reduces time overhead, improves accuracy, and provides a cost-effective alternative suitable for educational institutions, workplaces, and large-scale administrative environments.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why This Works

* Uses **precise, technical terms** (e.g., "subnet-based network authentication")
* Removes vague/ambiguous wording
* Clearly states **what the innovation is**
* Follows **IEEE tone and style** (formal, concise, objective)
* Addresses **problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí method ‚Üí benefit ‚Üí application**

Would you like help writing the rest of the paper in **IEEE format** (with sections like Introduction, Methodology, Results, etc.)?

Let me know and I can guide or generate a full outline and even help write the sections.
